    "Beta-binomial regression model accounting for overdispersion in binomial data is one of the simplest Bayesian models. In this package, we perform beta-binomial regression model by means of beta-binomial distribution with a logistic link.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we toss a coin for $N$ trials and observe the number of heads as $y$. The probability of heads is inferred based on the observed data $D$. Let $\\theta \\in [0,1]$ represent the rate parameter (probability of getting a head).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have several ways to estimate the paramters $\\theta$ from observed data $D$. However, these approaches do not account the uncertainty of the estimates and this may cause the problem of overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, if you have proportion data and no need to consider the overdispersion in clustered binomial data, binomial regression model can be adopted. However, if the data is overdispersed and you want to account for the uncertainty of parameter estimation, beta-binomial regression model can be considered. One of the examples is to select the informative clonal SNPs in single cell studies and it is also demonstrated to show how the Betabin package works. You may refer to [documentation.ipynb](https://github.com/StatBiomed/BetabinGLM/blob/main/docs/documentation.ipynb)."
